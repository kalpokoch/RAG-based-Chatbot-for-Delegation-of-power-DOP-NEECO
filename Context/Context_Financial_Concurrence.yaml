      Financial concurrence must precede approval by the final approving authority and be granted by a delegated officer in the F&A wing.
    remarks:
      - Proposals for CMD/Board approval require prior concurrence by Project/Corporate Finance Head and Director (Finance). In absence of Director (Finance), ED (Finance) may concur.
      - If the approving authority overrules concurring authority, reasons must be recorded and shared with next higher authority (not below CGM).
      - Approvals without financial concurrence or reporting overruling are invalid, and approving authority is personally liable.
      - Chairman can designate additional items requiring financial concurrence.
      - Director (Finance) may allow sub-delegation of concurrence powers under HOF to subordinate officers for flexibility.
