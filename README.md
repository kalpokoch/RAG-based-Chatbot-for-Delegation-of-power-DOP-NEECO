# RAG-based-Chatbot-for-Delegation-of-power-DOP-NEECO
✅ Your Requirements Recap:
Item	Details
🎯 Goal	Build a chatbot that answers questions from a Delegation of Powers document (factual, structured Q&A)
🧠 Model	You want accurate, efficient, and domain-aware answers
🖥️ Hardware	You have access to a Tesla V100 GPU (for training), but want free or cheap online hosting (no GPU for live inference)
🧳 Budget	Preferably free, or extremely low-cost
💬 Interaction	A simple chatbot interface or API is enough
🔄 Customization	You’re fine with fine-tuning, RAG, or both
📚 Data	Based on internal documents — structured policy rules

🏆 The Best Approach for You
✅ Use a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot with a quantized small model (e.g., Mistral or Phi-2)
💡 Why this works best:
You only fine-tune once using your V100 (cheap or free)

You avoid hosting large models live (expensive or impossible on free platforms)

You keep inference cheap using quantized CPU-friendly models or APIs

Your chatbot becomes accurate, fast, and deployable

🔧 Step-by-Step Plan
Phase	Tool / Platform	What You Do
1. ✍️ Data Prep	Local / GPT	Build a dataset of Q&A pairs (1000–3000) from your delegation rules
2. 🧠 Fine-tune a model (LoRA)	Tesla V100 + transformers	Fine-tune Mistral-7B-Instruct or Phi-2 using LoRA
3. 🧮 Build FAISS Index	Local	Embed your policy doc chunks using MiniLM or bge-small + FAISS
4. 📦 Quantize the model	bitsandbytes or gguf	Compress model to 4-bit so it fits on free hosts
5. 🛰️ Host the chatbot	Hugging Face Spaces (Free)	Run chatbot UI (Gradio) + FAISS + call quantized model
6. 🔁 LLM inference (if needed)	Hugging Face Inference API or run quantized model	Choose based on hosting ability: free endpoint or tiny model locally

🧩 Summary of Tech Stack
Component	Recommended Choice
Model	Mistral-7B-Instruct (best) or Phi-2 (lightest)
Fine-tuning	LoRA via transformers on V100
Embeddings	bge-small-en, all-MiniLM-L6-v2
Retriever	FAISS in memory
Hosting	Hugging Face Spaces (Gradio UI + Retriever)
Model inference	Use quantized model locally (4-bit) or via API

🧱 Deployment Architecture

Edit
User → Gradio UI (Hugging Face Spaces)
    → Embedding + FAISS (CPU)
    → Prompt + Context → Call to quantized LLM (Phi-2/Mistral)
